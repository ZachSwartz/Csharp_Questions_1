1. Q: What is a namespace?
   A: A namespace is used to organize code and provide a level of separation of the code. A namespace can be considered a container which consists of other namespaces, classes, or variables.

2. Q: What are value types?
   A: Value types are different variables that are directly assigned values. All of these values contain data.

3. Q: What are reference types?
   A: Reference types contain a value or data like a value type. They contain a reference to a variable. The refer to a memory location of another variable.

4. Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
   A: An automatic property is a property in C# that has a backing field generated by the compiler. This makes it possible to not have to write getters and setters that return a value of backing field or assign to it.

5. Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
   A: A using statement provides convenient syntax to make sure that the correct use of IDisposable objects is used. A using statement makes sure that Dispose is called even if there is an exception within the using block.

6. Q: What are dynamic type variables?
   A: A dynamic variable is a variable that escapes type checking when compiling. A dynamic type is resolved at runtime instead.

7. Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
   A: The is operator evaluates type compatibility at runtime. It will determine if an object instance or the result of an expression can be converted to the specified type.

8. Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
   A: Generics are type parameters which make it possible to design classes and methods that are different from the specification of one or more types until the class or method is declared or instantiated by the client code.

9. Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
   A: Only functions that belong to that same class can access its private members. A private access specifier allows a class to hide its member variables and member functions from other functions and objects.

10. Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
    A: Yes you can. Using the params keyword, you can specify a method parameter that takes a variable number of arguments.

11. Q: How do you sort an array?
    A: You can sort an array using Array.Sort(Array) with your array as a parameter.

12. Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
    A: A nullable type is a special data type that you can assign either a normal value or a null value.

13. Q: What is an enumeration?
    A: An enumeration type is a way to define a set of named integral constants that can be assigned to a variable.

14. Q: What is inheritance?
    A: Inheritance is what allows us to define a class in terms of another class. This make creating and maintaining an application much easier. Inheritance provides an opportunity to reuse code functionality which speeds up the time for implementation.

15. Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
    A: Multiple inheritance is not supported by C#.

16. Q: What is the purpose of as operator
    A: an Operator is a symbol that specifies which operation to perform in an expression such as math, indexing, function calls, etc.

17. Q: What is an object?
    A: An object is a block of memory that has been allocated and configured. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection.

18. Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
    A: Structs are value types and classes are reference types.

19. Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
    A: The break statement will break the loop/switch and the continue statement will skip the execution of the current iteration on the enclosing while loop, do while loop, for loop, or for each statement it appears.

20. Q: What is this and how is it used?
    A: The This keyword references the current instance of a class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.

21. Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
    A: The try block tries some code until a catch exception is thrown or it is completed successfully.

22. Q: How is exception handling done?
    A: Exception handling provides a way to transfer control from one part of the program to another. Exception handling in C# is done using four keywords. Try, catch, finally, and throw. The try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions are activated. A try block is followed by one or more catch blocks. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception in the code. The finally block executes a given set of statements if an exception is thrown or not. The throw keyword is used when the program throws an exception.

23. Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
    A: The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, if an exception is thrown or not.

24. Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    A: An Array is a strongly typed collection of data that is of the same type. Arrays have fixed lengths or sizes and they can not be changed when a program is running. We can access different elements in arrays by their index number. All Array indexes start at 0.
    An ArrayList is a collection of different or the same data types that is not strongly typed. The size of ArrayList's can increase or decrease dynamically. This allows ArrayLists to take any size of values of any data type.

25. Q: What is an object?
    A: An object is a block of memory that has been allocated and configured. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection.

26. Q: Define constructor.
    A: A constructor is a special method of the class which gets automatically invoked whenever an instance of the class is created. A constructor also contains the collection of instructions that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is used to assign initial values to the data members of the same class.

27. Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
    A: Var can be used to declare local variables with out stating an explicit type. The var keyword tells the compiler to infer the type of the variable. The type may be a built in type, an anonymous type, user-defined type, or type from the .NET framework class library.

28. Q: What is an abstract class?
    A: An abstract class is the way to achieve abstraction in the C# language. An abstract class is not meant to be instantiated directly. To be an abstract class, the class has to contain at least one abstract method. Abstract methods are marked with the keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. Abstract classes are typically defined as a base class in the class hierarchy.

29. Q: What is an interface?
    A: An interface is like a class. They can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. The main difference is that interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. Interface members will be implemented by a given class that implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.

30. Q: What is a method?
    A:  A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements. The calling program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and passing the required method arguments.

31. Q: What is a property?
    A: A property is a member. This member provides flexible mechanisms to read, write, or compute values from a private field. Properties are used like they are public data members. but they are actually special methods called accessors. This enables easy data access and promotes the flexibility and safety of methods.

32. Q: What is an access specifier?
    A: An access specifier describes the accessibility of an object and its members. All C# types and members have an accessibility level. We can control the member object of a class using access specifiers.

33. Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
    A: -Public-
    Can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.

    -Private-
    Can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.

    -Protected-
    Can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.

    -Internal-
    Can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

    -Protected Internal-
    Can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.

    -Private Protected-
    Can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.



34. Q: What is a collection?
    A: Collections are specialized classes for data retrieval and storage. Collections provide support for hash tables, lists, queues, and stacks.

35. Q: What is a Hash Table?
    A: Hashtable classes represent a collection of key and value pairs. These are organized based on the hash code of the key. It uses the key to access the elements in the collections.
